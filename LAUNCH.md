# Your steps

**What this file is.** The things only you can do: accounts, money, legal,
dashboards, and anything needing a credential or a decision that is yours to
make. `ROADMAP.md` is the other half, what gets built, by task ID.

Keep this file. Tick things off in it rather than in chat, so the next person
reading the repo can see what was actually done and when.

Launch target: **weekend of 11 October 2026.**

## Blocking, before you launch

### 1. Create the contact mailbox

`hello@klik.kreativvantage.com` is printed on both legal pages and is the
**DMCA notice address**. It does not exist yet. Until it does, every privacy
request and every copyright notice goes nowhere, which for DMCA purposes is
worse than publishing no page at all.

Create it, or tell Claude the right address. It lives in one line of
`lib/legal.ts`.

- [ ] Mailbox exists and somebody reads it

### 2. Confirm two facts Claude had to guess

Both are in `lib/legal.ts`, one line each.

- [ ] **Governing law.** The terms say **Missouri**, inferred from the 314 area
      code on the support line. Wrong if the entity is registered elsewhere.
- [ ] **Legal entity name.** The pages say **Kreativ Vantage**. It must match
      the registered name exactly, and must match the DMCA filing.

### 3. Read what you are publishing

You declined legal review, which is your call. Read both pages anyway:
[/terms](https://klik.kreativvantage.com/terms) and
[/privacy](https://klik.kreativvantage.com/privacy). They make specific
promises, including that deletion completes everywhere within 31 days.

- [ ] Read both, end to end

### 4. Turn on error alerts

Without this, the first production failure is found by a customer.

```bash
printf 'you@yourdomain.com' | vercel env add ALERT_EMAIL production
vercel --prod
```

- [ ] Set, deployed, and Claude has confirmed a test error actually arrives

### 5. Check whether your database has a backup at all

`ROADMAP.md` says this plainly: Neon point-in-time restore depends on your
plan, and **no restore has ever been tested**. An untested backup is a belief.
Media is now safe in a locked second bucket; the database is not.

Check the Neon dashboard for your plan's PITR window. If it is zero, that is a
launch blocker, not a nicety.

- [ ] PITR window confirmed, and the number written here: ______

### 6. Walk the funnel yourself

**The highest-value hour left before launch.** Every test so far has been
synthetic: API calls and curl. No human has been through it.

On a real phone, as a stranger would:

1. Open the pricing page, pick a plan
2. Sign up, pay
3. Wait for the activation email, check it actually arrives
4. Open the dashboard from the link in that email
5. Create an event
6. Print the QR sign
7. Scan it on a second phone, agree to the consent notice
8. Upload a photo and a video
9. View the gallery, open the lightbox
10. Download the zip

Send Claude anything that breaks. The CORS bug found this week is proof that
this category of failure exists and that no test suite catches it.

- [ ] Walked end to end on a real device

## Soon after launch

- [ ] **File the DMCA designation.** Brief already sent. $6, renews every three
      years. Not retroactive, so cover starts the day it is filed.
- [ ] **Diary the DMCA renewal**, three years out
- [ ] **Create a Sentry account** so F-9 can replace the email-alert stopgap
- [ ] **Decide sales tax nexus** with an accountant (`ROADMAP.md` LAW-6)
